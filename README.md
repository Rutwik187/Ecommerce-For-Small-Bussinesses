Creating your own online store may seem daunting, but we've broken down the process into simple steps that even non-technical individuals can follow. Let's get started!

## Part 1: Setting Up the Backend (Using Sanity)

1. **Create a Gmail Account:**
   
   If you don't already have a Gmail account, you can create one [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup).

3. **Clone the Repository and Cleanup:**
   
   - Clone the repository that you'll use for your online store.
   - Delete the `.github` folder in the cloned repository to keep things tidy.

5. **Open in Code Editor:**
   
   Open the cloned repository using your preferred code editor (like Visual Studio Code).

7. **Install Backend Dependencies:**
   
   In your terminal, navigate to the `sanity-ecom` folder and run:
    ```npm install --force```
  
9.  **Install Sanity Backend Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the `sanity_backend` folder using: ```cd sanity_backend``` and then run:  ``` npm install --force```

11. **Log in to Sanity:**
