# Technologies Used

## Frontend Framework: Next.js

Next.js, a powerful React framework, was utilized for building the frontend of the application. It offers server-side rendering, routing, and other essential features that enhance both performance and user experience.

## Styling: Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, was chosen to handle the styling aspects of the project. Its modular approach allowed for rapid and consistent UI development by composing classes to create custom designs.

## Messaging Integration: WhatsApp API

The WhatsApp API was employed to seamlessly integrate messaging capabilities into the application. This enabled the system to send messages via WhatsApp, facilitating real-time communication with users.

## Content Management: Sanity

For efficient content management, the headless content management system Sanity was adopted. By decoupling content from the presentation layer, Sanity provided a structured and flexible approach to managing and organizing content.

Each of these technologies played a pivotal role in the development and functionality of the application, contributing to a robust and user-friendly final product.

# Free Sanity Account Limitations

Free accounts on Sanity offer a range of features and capabilities for content management and collaboration. However, there are certain limitations that users should be aware of when utilizing the free tier of Sanity.

## Data Storage Limit

The data storage capacity for a free Sanity account is limited to approximately 5,000 documents. These documents encompass various forms of content, including articles, images, and structured data entries. It's important to manage your content within this limit to ensure optimal performance and usage of the free tier.

## API Request Limit

Free accounts come with a monthly limit on the number of API requests that can be made. This limit is typically set at around 50,000 API requests per month. It's essential to keep track of your API usage to prevent exceeding this limit, which could impact the functionality of your application.

## Asset Storage Restrictions

The free tier of Sanity includes restrictions on asset storage. Asset storage pertains to images, videos, and other media files that are uploaded to the Sanity platform. Users of the free tier are allocated approximately 5 GB of asset storage. Monitoring and managing your asset uploads within this limit is crucial for maintaining a seamless experience.

## Collaborator Limit

Collaboration within a free Sanity account is limited in terms of the number of users who can access and contribute to a project. Typically, free accounts allow around 2 to 3 collaborators. Collaborators include team members who require access to the Sanity project for content creation, management, and editing.

It's recommended to plan your team's access carefully to ensure that the designated collaborators have the necessary permissions to effectively work within the constraints of the free tier.
